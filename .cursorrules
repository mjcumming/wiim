# WiiM Integration Rules

## Core Principle
This is a THIN INTEGRATION LAYER between pywiim and Home Assistant. We do NOT:
- Make things up
- Fix pywiim bugs (report them instead)
- Dream up new features
- Calculate values that pywiim should provide

## What We Do
- Use pywiim exactly as intended
- Read values directly from pywiim Player/Group objects
- Pass through pywiim methods and properties
- Report issues to user if pywiim doesn't provide what we need

## Group Media Player Volume
- Use the volume from pywiim's group player object
- Do NOT calculate maximum volume from members
- Do NOT make up group volume logic
- If pywiim doesn't provide group volume, report it - don't work around it

## When pywiim is missing something
- Tell the user immediately
- Do NOT create workarounds
- Do NOT implement missing functionality ourselves
- The fix belongs in pywiim, not here
