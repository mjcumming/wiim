All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.16] - 2025-01-08

### üéØ CRITICAL FIX: Multiroom Group Detection

- **Fixed critical API parsing bug in `getSlaveList` response handling**
- **Root Cause**: Integration incorrectly expected `slaves` field to sometimes be a list
- **Actual API Format**: `slaves` is always integer count, `slave_list` is the array of slave objects
- **Impact**: Multiroom master/slave detection now works reliably

### Fixed

- **Eliminated "SLAVE LIST ISSUE: reports N slaves but slaves field is integer" errors**
- Masters now correctly populate `group_members` from `slave_list` array
- Slave devices can now properly find their master speakers in the registry
- "Could not find master for slave" errors resolved
- Multiroom group operations (join/unjoin/volume sync) now function correctly

### Technical Details

- Updated `get_multiroom_info()` to parse API response according to WiiM specification
- `slaves`: Integer count of slave devices (always present)
- `slave_list`: Array of slave objects with name, IP, UUID, etc. (present when slaves > 0)
- Added comprehensive validation and consistency checking
- Enhanced logging shows detailed slave information for debugging

### API Documentation Updated

- **API_GUIDE.md** updated with correct `getSlaveList` response format
- Added examples of both populated and empty slave list responses
- Documented the parsing fix and its impact on multiroom functionality

### Breaking Changes

- None for users - this is a pure bug fix that makes multiroom features work as intended
- Developers: `get_multiroom_info()` now returns properly structured data

## [0.4.15] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- **Enhanced non-WiiM device filtering in group operations**
- More aggressive validation removes non-WiiM devices from group member lists
- Better logging shows exactly which entities are filtered out and why
- Stricter entity validation prevents accidental inclusion of incompatible devices

### Technical

- Enhanced `async_join` method with stricter WiiM-only filtering
- Added comprehensive logging for group member validation process
- Improved entity identification using entity ID patterns and coordinator lookup
- Better error messages for troubleshooting group operations

### Known Limitation

- Home Assistant's native grouping UI may still show all media players in the selection list
- This is a Home Assistant UI behavior we cannot control from our integration
- However, our integration will automatically filter out non-WiiM devices when processing the group
- Check the logs to see which entities were filtered out during group operations

## [0.4.14] - 2025-01-06

### Improved

- **Enhanced grouping flexibility: All WiiM devices now available for grouping**
- Solo devices: ‚úÖ Join directly to new groups
- Slave devices: ‚úÖ Leave current group first, then join new group
- Master devices: ‚úÖ Disband current group first, then join as slave
- Smarter integration logic handles all necessary group transitions automatically

### Technical

- Simplified `_can_be_grouped()` logic to be more inclusive
- Integration now handles complex group state transitions behind the scenes
- Better utilization of existing group management commands
- Only non-WiiM devices and virtual masters are excluded from join lists

## [0.4.13] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- **Major UX improvement: Intelligent device filtering for join/unjoin lists**
- Only WiiM devices that can actually be joined now appear in grouping interface
- Eliminated confusion from non-WiiM devices (HomePod, Sony TV, etc.) in join lists
- Slaves and active group masters no longer appear as joinable options

### Improved

- **Dynamic grouping feature enablement based on device state**
- Solo devices: ‚úÖ Can be joined (GROUPING enabled)
- Slaves: ‚ùå Cannot be joined (GROUPING disabled)
- Active masters: ‚ùå Cannot be joined (GROUPING disabled)
- Much cleaner and more intuitive grouping interface

### Technical

- Replaced static `GROUPING` feature with dynamic `supported_features` property
- Implemented intelligent `_can_be_grouped()` logic based on device role and state
- Enhanced device state awareness for grouping operations
- Improved logging for grouping feature decisions

## [0.4.12] - 2025-01-06

### Improved

- **Enhanced join/unjoin UX in Home Assistant Actions UI**
- Virtual master entities no longer appear in join/unjoin device lists
- Cleaner device selection when creating multiroom groups
- Virtual masters already have "Master" in their names for clear identification

### Technical

- Removed `MediaPlayerEntityFeature.GROUPING` from virtual master entities
- Virtual masters represent group coordinators and shouldn't be joinable to other groups
- Reduces confusion in Home Assistant's native grouping interface

## [0.4.11] - 2025-01-06

- Fixed linter error with invalid `MEDIA_SEEK` feature

### Improved

- Added lazy initialization for StateManager to prevent timing issues
- Added fallback method when StateManager is unavailable during startup
- Enhanced error handling during entity initialization phase
- Better robustness during Home Assistant startup sequence

### Technical

- StateManager now initializes safely after `hass` attribute is available
- Improved entity lifecycle management during coordinator updates
- Removed invalid MediaPlayerEntityFeature that doesn't exist in current HA

## [0.4.9] - 2025-01-06

### Removed

- **Removed unnecessary "Home Assistant Grouping" configuration option**
- Simplified configuration by always enabling `MediaPlayerEntityFeature.GROUPING`

### Improved

- JOIN button and `media_player.join`/`unjoin` service calls now always available
- Cleaner configuration UI with less confusing options
- Better adherence to Home Assistant's grouping design principles

### Technical

- Home Assistant's grouping system is designed to delegate to integration methods
