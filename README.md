| **Quick Stations**    | Custom radio station list in Browse Media                                     |

| **Auto-Discovery**    | Finds speakers automatically via UPnP/Zeroconf                                |
| **Real-Time Updates** | UPnP event subscriptions for instant state changes with HTTP polling fallback |

## How It Works

The integration uses a **hybrid approach** combining UPnP event subscriptions and HTTP polling for optimal reliability and responsiveness:

- **UPnP Events (Primary)**: Real-time state updates via DLNA DMR event subscriptions

  - Instant updates when device state changes (play/pause/volume/mute)
  - Reduces network traffic and improves responsiveness
  - Automatically falls back to polling if UPnP becomes unavailable

- **HTTP Polling (Fallback)**: Adaptive polling strategy ensures reliability
  - 1-second polling during active playback for position updates
  - 5-second polling when idle for resource efficiency
  - Always available as fallback if UPnP subscriptions fail
  - Gracefully handles network issues and device restarts

This dual approach ensures you get the best of both worlds: real-time responsiveness when UPnP is working, and reliable operation even when it's not.

## Usage Examples

### Multiroom Audio

```yaml
# Create speaker group
service: media_player.join
target:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room
data:
  group_members:
    - media_player.kitchen
    - media_player.bedroom

# Remove from group
service: media_player.unjoin
target:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room
```

### Custom Radio Stations

Create `wiim_stations.yaml` in your config folder:

```yaml
- name: BBC Radio 2
  url: http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_two

  url: http://ice2.somafm.com/groovesalad-128-mp3
```

Access via **Browse Media ‚Üí Quick Stations** on any WiiM device.

### Audio Output Control

```yaml
# Switch to Bluetooth output

## Source Customization

### Why Source Renaming Isn't Supported

The WiiM integration doesn't support custom source names for several reasons:

- **Device Limitation**: Source names come directly from the device's firmware and API
- **Consistency**: Other major integrations (Sonos, Denon, Yamaha) also don't support source renaming
- **API Compatibility**: The device expects specific source names for proper functionality
- **Automation Reliability**: Custom names could break existing automations and scripts

### How to Work Around This

Instead of renaming sources, you can customize the display in several ways:

#### 1. Rename the Media Player Entity

```yaml
# In customize.yaml
media_player.living_room_speaker:
  friendly_name: "Living Room TV Audio"
```

#### 2. Use Templates in Automations

```yaml
# In automations.yaml
- alias: "When HDMI is selected"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
    attribute: source
    to: "HDMI"
  action:
    - service: notify.persistent_notification
      data:
        message: "TV audio is now active"
```

#### 3. Create Custom Dashboard Cards

```yaml
# In Lovelace dashboard
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: media_player.living_room_speaker
    name: "TV Audio"
    secondary_info: "{{ states('media_player.living_room_speaker').attributes.source }}"
```

## Diagnostics & Troubleshooting

When experiencing issues, you can download comprehensive diagnostic information to help with troubleshooting:

1. **Device Diagnostics**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí WiiM Audio ‚Üí (Select device) ‚Üí Download Diagnostics
2. **Integration Diagnostics**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí WiiM Audio ‚Üí (‚ãÆ Menu) ‚Üí Download Diagnostics

The diagnostics include:

- Device information (model, firmware, network status)
- Multiroom group configuration and roles
- Media playback state and current sources
- API polling status and error tracking
- EQ settings and sound modes

**All sensitive data (IP addresses, MAC addresses, network names) is automatically redacted.**
