# WiiM Integration Implementation TODO - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH

## 🎯 Mission: Restore Full Media Player Functionality Using Single Controller Architecture

**Goal**: Implement all missing WiiM media player features using our simplified controller architecture while maintaining clean separation of concerns and robust error handling.

**Key Decision**: **Single MediaPlayerController** instead of 6 separate controllers to avoid over-engineering while maintaining proper separation of concerns.

---

## 🚨 Design Decisions & Intentional Exclusions

### Power Control - Intentionally Excluded ⚠️

**Decision**: Power control features are **intentionally excluded** from this integration.

**Rationale**:

- WiiM devices have **inconsistent power control implementation** across different models and firmware versions
- Some devices don't support power control via API at all
- Power states are often unreliable or incorrectly reported by the device
- Physical power buttons and auto-sleep functionality vary significantly between models
- Network connectivity requirements conflict with true "off" states
- Implementing power control would require device-specific workarounds that compromise overall reliability

**User Alternatives**:

- Use physical power buttons on WiiM devices
- Rely on built-in auto-sleep functionality
- Use network-level controls (smart switches) if needed
- Utilize WiiM's native power management features

This decision prioritizes **reliable core functionality** over potentially problematic power features.
